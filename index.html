<h2>Project 1:</h2>
<p>You're looking at it.
      This website is going to be a long, drawn out project that I'm slowly going to build up on as I continually learn more about the programming languages, HTML and 
      CSS. For now, I haven't figured out any of the CSS functions, but the HTML basics seem pretty clear at least. Eventually, i'm going to have all sorts of things on
      here, but this is just a start. Sorry if it looks really messy though. As said, CSS. - October 15, 2022</p>
    
<h3>Project 2</h3>
<p>Ever seen wings that can bend like a bird's on an airplane? Maybe, but if you're like most of us who hven't, you sure will soon enough! As of late, a new concept
      of Flex wings has been on the news lately, and it means we can finally do something about the fact that airplanes emmitt so much Carbon Dioxide! Basically, i'm trying
      to make and prove the validity of this new concept of wings by building a replica of an airplane (Airbus A320) using, wait for it, PLA Plastic (That gooey white stuff
      that comes out of 3D printer nozzle and is somehow really strong), but only the frame, as it is too strong to make up the wing. That, will be made with "Thermosetting
      polyimide", basically another gooey white stubstance that's even stronger and more flexible. I have the base done, and I need to order the Thermosetting Polyimide
      off amazon, which i'm going to do this week. In the meantime, enjoy this really cool photo of a bullet that has weird shapes on it. - October 15, 2022.</p>
